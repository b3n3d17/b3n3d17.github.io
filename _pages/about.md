I embarked on my career journey as a chemical technician at
[Roche Diagnostics GmbH in Penzberg](https://www.roche.de/ueber-roche/standorte/penzberg/),
laying the foundation for my professional growth. Fueled by a curiosity, I pursued
higher education, earning both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Sciences
from the [University of Applied Sciences Kempten](https://www.hs-kempten.de/).
During my academic journey, I blended my technological aspirations with the serene
landscapes of the Allgäu region, finding inspiration in the mountains and on the road bike.

My academic voyage reached its zenith with a thesis at [Siemens AG](https://siemens.com)
in Munich, which provided a practical perspective on the tech world. Today, I
proudly serve as a Research Scientist at Siemens AG. In this role, I research
and consult on cybersecurity domains such as container security, mobile application
security, and privacy, collaborating closely with my talented colleagues.

I've also had the privilege of being part of a dynamic team at Siemens, where we
collectively developed and conducted container security training programs. As a
trainer, I've been able to share my knowledge and practical insights, helping
professionals stay at the forefront of container security best practices.

Notably, since 2024 my colleagues [Patrick Stöckle](https://pstoeckle.github.io/) and I
conduct a [practicum on container security](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/sse/lehre/practical-course-container-security/)
at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).
