I started my career as a chemical technician at <a href ="https://www.roche.de/ueber-roche/standorte/penzberg/">Roche Diagnostics GmbH in Penzberg.
Inspired to learn more I continued my studies with a Bachelor and Masters degree in Computer Sciences at the <a href="https://www.hs-kempten.de/">University of Applied Sciences Kempten</a>.
There I combined my passion for technology with the beautiful nature of the Allg√§u region.
I finished my degree with a thesis at <a href="https://siemens.com"> Siemens AG </a> in Munich.
Currently, I am working there as a Cybersecurity Architect.
In my role I am researching and consulting on blockchain security, container security and privacy topics together with my colleges.
