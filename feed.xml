This project represents a modern approach to museum technology, combining robust backend architecture with an intuitive user experience.</p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 2rem 0;"> <iframe src="https://murnau.audio-guide.cloud" width="375" height="667" style="border: 2px solid #333; border-radius: 25px; box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);" title="Murnau Audio Guide - Mobile Preview"> </iframe> </div> <h2 id="technical-architecture--security-first-design">Technical Architecture &amp; Security-First Design</h2> <p>The platform is built using Go as the primary backend language, emphasizing minimal dependencies and maximum security. The application consists of two main components: a public-facing guide application and a comprehensive admin interface for content management.</p> <p>The guide application utilizes <a href="https://github.com/a-h/templ">Templ</a> for type-safe HTML templating, providing excellent developer experience and compile-time safety. This choice enables server-side rendering while maintaining modern web standards. The backend is powered by SQLite for data persistence, offering reliability and simplicity with zero external database dependencies.</p> <p>For interactive frontend behavior, the platform leverages <a href="https://htmx.org">HTMX</a>, which perfectly aligns with the project’s philosophy of simplicity and minimal dependencies. HTMX extends HTML’s natural hypermedia capabilities, allowing any element to make HTTP requests and target specific DOM elements for updates - not just anchors and forms. This approach eliminates the need for complex JavaScript frameworks while providing modern interactive features like AJAX, CSS transitions, and dynamic content updates. At only ~14k minified and gzipped, HTMX maintains the project’s lightweight footprint while delivering the interactivity expected in modern web applications without build steps or compilation requirements.</p> <p>For internationalization, the platform supports eleven languages (German, English, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese) using the ctxi18n library, making the museum’s content accessible to a diverse international audience.</p> <h2 id="features-and-functionality">Features and Functionality</h2> <p>The audio guide covers multiple exhibitions within the Schlossmuseum Murnau, including “Gabriele Münter &amp; Expressionism,” “The Blue Rider - A Homage,” “Cabinet of Curiosities,” and historical content about Murnau itself. Each exhibit features high-quality audio content with accompanying images and detailed descriptions.</p> <p>The admin interface provides museum staff with comprehensive content management capabilities. Built with the same Go/Templ stack, it includes features for managing exhibitions, audio content, exhibit metadata, and user analytics. The admin system integrates with Google Cloud services for text-to-speech generation and translation capabilities, streamlining content localization workflows.</p> <h2 id="container-first-architecture--security">Container-First Architecture &amp; Security</h2> <p>The platform leverages Go’s static compilation capabilities to create minimal, secure container images. Using multi-stage Docker builds with pinned base image SHA hashes, the final containers contain only the compiled binary and essential runtime dependencies, resulting in significantly smaller attack surfaces and faster deployment times.</p> <p>Container security is enforced through multiple layers: read-only filesystems prevent runtime modifications, all Linux capabilities are dropped, processes run as unprivileged users (nobody:nobody), and no-new-privileges policies prevent privilege escalation. This defense-in-depth approach, combined with Nginx for SSL termination and Let’s Encrypt certificate management, creates a robust security posture.</p> <p>In addition, the simple setup with sqlite allows that the public facing application only has the database mounted readonly ensuring no modifications are possible with minimal effort.</p> <h2 id="cicd--deployment">CI/CD &amp; Deployment</h2> <p>The platform uses automated CI/CD with container builds, security scanning, and Ansible-based deployment. The pipeline handles everything from building images to server provisioning and backup, enabling rapid iteration with minimal manual effort.</p> <h2 id="cost-effective-server-alternative">Cost-Effective Server Alternative</h2> <p>Rather than Function-as-a-Service, I chose traditional server deployment due to cost economics. As I <a href="/news">previously noted</a>, Cloud Run with persistent storage becomes expensive - NFS volumes start at $200/month, ironically requiring VMs for “serverless” applications.</p> <p>The server approach provides predictable costs, direct filesystem access(sqlite shared across 2 containers), simplified architecture, and better performance for persistent data applications like audio guides. Proper automation delivers serverless-like operational benefits without the FaaS cost penalty and lock in.</p> <p>The containerized architecture makes future migration to Kubernetes trivial if vertical scaling becomes necessary. However, managed K8s services would be complete overkill for a single museum - by the time such scaling is needed, the platform should generate enough revenue to justify those ongoing costs.</p> <h2 id="impact-and-innovation">Impact and Innovation</h2> <p>This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can enhance cultural experiences while maintaining enterprise-grade security and operational efficiency. By combining Go’s performance and reliability with contemporary frontend approaches and hardened container deployment, the platform delivers a scalable solution that serves both museum visitors and administrative staff effectively.</p> <p>The modular architecture, minimal dependency footprint, and container-first design allow for easy expansion to additional museums or exhibitions, making it a versatile and maintainable platform for cultural institutions seeking to digitize their visitor experience with minimal operational overhead.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="golang,"/><category term="web-development,"/><category term="audio-guide,"/><category term="museums,"/><category term="sqlite,"/><category term="templ"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A deep dive into developing a multilingual audio guide platform using Go, Templ, and modern web technologies for the Schlossmuseum Murnau]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Racing Thursdays at the Allianz Arena - My Munich Bike Stars Experience</title><link href="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2025/munich-bike-stars-racing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Racing Thursdays at the Allianz Arena - My Munich Bike Stars Experience"/><published>2025-08-02T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-02T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2025/munich-bike-stars-racing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2025/munich-bike-stars-racing/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="racing-thursdays-at-the-allianz-arena">Racing Thursdays at the Allianz Arena</h1> <p>When I first heard about the <a href="https://www.munichbikestars.de/">Munich Bike Stars Donnerstagsrennen</a>, I was both intrigued and intimidated. Racing at 18:00 on a Thursday evening, right next to the Allianz Arena? It sounded exciting and terrifying in equal measure.</p> <p>The Munich Bike Stars Thursday races are something special in the German cycling scene. Since 2019, every summer a 1.5-kilometer circuit at Kurt-Landauer-Weg transforms into Munich’s cycling hotspot. What started with 150 participants has grown to regularly seeing over 190 racers each Thursday from May through July.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Format</p> </blockquote> <p>The races follow a criterium format with intermediate sprint points. Victory isn’t just about crossing the finish line first - it’s about accumulating points throughout the race. Every third lap features sprint points (5/3/2/1 points for places 1-4), with double points in the final sprint. This creates incredibly dynamic racing at speeds averaging 43-46.5 km/h.</p> <p>The concept is brilliant: “Die etwas andere Feierabendrunde” (the somewhat different after-work ride). Four race categories accommodate everyone from youth racers to elite amateurs, licensed and unlicensed riders alike.</p> <blockquote> <p>My Experience</p> </blockquote> <p>My first race was pure survival - learning criterium tactics while racing at 43 km/h around tight corners. What struck me most was the community spirit. Despite racing for individual glory and the coveted Munich Bike Stars title, riders looked out for each other and shared tactical advice.</p> <p>As the 2025 season concludes, I’m already training for next year. The goal? Win one race in the Hobby category and move up to the Jedermann category.</p> <p><strong>Hauptsache Ballern!</strong> (Main thing is to give it everything!)</p> <hr/> <p><em>Thanks to all the Munich Bike Stars volunteers and fellow racers who made Thursday evenings so special!</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life"/><category term="cycling,"/><category term="racing,"/><category term="munich,"/><category term="criterium,"/><category term="donnerstagsrennen"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A season of criterium racing at Munich's famous Donnerstagsrennen - from hobby racer to the hunt for the Munich Bike Stars title]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SANS London April 2024</title><link href="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2024/london-sec522/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SANS London April 2024"/><published>2024-04-13T13:37:42+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-13T13:37:42+00:00</updated><id>https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2024/london-sec522</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2024/london-sec522/"><![CDATA[<p>This week I had the chance to enjoy the <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/application-security-securing-web-apps-api-microservices/">SEC522</a> course held by <a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich/">Johannes Ullrich</a>.

The OAuth 2.0 framework was designed to facilitate secure access management in distributed systems, but it often poses challenges, especially when it comes to managing sensitive secrets like client IDs and client secrets. The solution to this complex issue lies in “Service Account Token Volume Projection,” a concept introduced by Kubernetes that injects JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) into workloads.</p> <p>This <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp/">IETF draft</a> outlines how these JWTs can be employed to handle client credentials in container orchestration systems. Its primary aim is to enhance interoperability within orchestration systems while reducing complexities for developers. Moreover, it incentivizes authorization servers to support RFC 7523, a crucial aspect of OAuth 2.0.</p> <p>Traditionally, provisioning unique credentials for every workload instance was a manual and cumbersome process, devoid of automated rotation mechanisms. This not only added inconvenience but also increased the attack surface. Service Account Token Volume Projection changes the game by enabling the creation of JWTs known as Service Account Tokens. These tokens act as client credentials, eliminating the need for client ID and client secret configurations.</p> <p>Additionally, the feature permits automated token rotation and ensures that private keys for token signing are handled by the control plane, further reducing manual configuration efforts. However, the lack of a standardized approach for managing these tokens across various container orchestrators and lacking wide spread support by authorization servers leads to additional development efforts. In a PoC I used this approach with <a href="https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver">Duende Identity Server</a>. And there I needed to modify the credential verifiaction in order for this approach to work.</p> <p>This IETF draft presents a standardized approach for managing Service Account Tokens in container orchestration systems. By doing so, it promotes a secure and scalable method for creating and managing these tokens while ensuring seamless integration with existing OAuth-based authorization systems.</p> <p>In a nutshell, this approach simplifies the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration, making it more developer-friendly, secure, and efficient. It’s a significant step forward in the realm of container orchestration, promising a brighter and more secure future for microservices and their interaction with the broader network.</p> <p>Please get involved in the discussion <a href="mailto:draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp@ietf.org?subject=Mail%20regarding%20draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp">here</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="cybersecurity,"/><category term="ietf"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discussing a method for simplified oauth client authentication for orchestrated containerized microservices]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SANS Offensive Operations London 2023</title><link href="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2023/london/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SANS Offensive Operations London 2023"/><published>2023-02-11T14:00:16+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-11T14:00:16+00:00</updated><id>https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2023/london</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2023/london/"><![CDATA[<p>In the spring of 2023, I embarked on a unique journey to London, where the world of cybersecurity and the cultural treasures of the city seamlessly merged. At the heart of my visit was the SANS Offensive Operations course, but London had much more to offer than just technical knowledge.</p> <p>SANS Offensive Operations Course: This intensive program provided a deep dive into offensive cybersecurity. Through hands-on labs and expert guidance, I honed my skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and exploit development. Collaborating with professionals from diverse backgrounds enriched the learning experience. <a href="https://blog.nviso.eu/author/jbeckers/">Jeroen Beckers</a> was the trainer for SEC575 Mobile Device Security and Ethical Hacking.</p> <p>Exploring London’s Rich Heritage: Beyond the course, I immersed myself in London’s historical gems. Windsor Castle, with its regal charm, offered a glimpse into royal history. The Tower of London, home to the Crown Jewels, was a journey through centuries of intrigue. Buckingham Palace’s Changing of the Guard ceremony showcased British traditions, while the British Museum housed treasures from around the world, highlighting human civilization’s richness.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: My London trip was a perfect blend of professional growth and cultural immersion. I left not only with enhanced cybersecurity skills but also with a deep appreciation for London’s history and traditions. It was an experience that enriched my mind and soul, leaving me with lasting memories of both cybersecurity challenges and the timeless allure of London’s landmarks.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="cybersecurity,"/><category term="sans"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEC575 Mobile Device Security and Ethical Hacking]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Collabs Info Day</title><link href="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2022/novi_sad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collabs Info Day"/><published>2022-10-12T14:00:16+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-12T14:00:16+00:00</updated><id>https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2022/novi_sad</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hofmannb.dev/blog/2022/novi_sad/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="novi-sad-12102022-14102022">Novi Sad 12.10.2022-14.10.2022</h1> <p>You can find the link to the official blog post <a href="https://www.collabs-project.eu/collabs-info-day/">here</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Impressions of Novi Sad</p> </blockquote> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202210novisad/01-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202210novisad/01-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202210novisad/01-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202210novisad/01.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null;

Initially we were all about going there by train to save the planet and all. But sadly the price, duration and booking process was very unappealing. We then looked into flights but they were way to expensive. So … in the end we opted for the 4 wheels again which was actually the cheapest option when traveling with 3 people.</p> <blockquote> <p>Driving to france</p> </blockquote> <p>The drive itself was quiet relaxing. We started very early to avoid any traffic jams on the brenner. The only traffic jams we encountered were near Genua on the autostrada towards Imperia. All in all, quiet uneventful.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/1driveto-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/1driveto-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/1driveto-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/1driveto.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Driving from Brixen to Bozen through the beautiful alps.</p> <blockquote> <p>Arriving in Agay</p> </blockquote> <p>Agay itselfe is a small town you get to it via St. Raphael which is the bigger town in the area. Agay seems to be comprised of mostly touristic buildings with no <em>normal</em> businesses. We stayed at a big resort near Agay which consists of tourist bunkers :smile:, pools, restaurants and sport areas.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/2agay-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/2agay-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/2agay-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/2agay.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>View of Agay.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/3food-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/3food-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/3food-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/3food.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Awesome food we ate at <em>Chez Georges</em> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/g9im22LnCAkiCV8j6">google maps</a> - <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1080032-d1333299-Reviews-Scarparo_le_Bluegreen-Agay_Saint_Raphael_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alp.html?m=19905">tripadvisor</a>. He really is an artist.</p> <blockquote> <p>Trip to Saint-Tropez</p> </blockquote> <p>We decided to also visit Saint Tropez. Initially we wanted to go there by ferry but we screwed up translating the website and had to return from the harbor and go by car. Actually, the traffic from Agay to Staint Tropez is insane :smile:.</p> <p>When we arrived, we visited the harbor and looked at some expensive yachts, expensively clothed people and the the castle. The castle actually contained a museum and some beautiful views.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/4sttpz-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/4sttpz-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/4sttpz-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/4sttpz.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/5sttpz2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/5sttpz2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/5sttpz2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/5sttpz2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <blockquote> <p>Hiking</p> </blockquote> <p>We also did some hiking if you wanna call it that. Outside of Agay there are beautiful <em>cliffs</em> of red stone. You have a good view on the sea and Agay.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/6agayover-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/6agayover-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/6agayover-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/6agayover.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <blockquote> <p>Drive Home</p> </blockquote> <p>The drive home was more stressful as we could not avoid the traffic jams near the lake garda. But still we got a view gorgeous views of italy.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/202206france/7drivefrom-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/202206france/7drivefrom-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/202206france/7drivefrom-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/202206france/7drivefrom.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life"/><category term="france,"/><category term="travel,"/><category term="europe"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traveling to the south of france and enjoying the sea, people and food.]]></summary></entry></feed>
