# SANS Offensive Operations London 2023 

At a beautiful locaion in Victoria London I got the chance to participate in my first SANS training.
[Jeroen Beckers](https://blog.nviso.eu/author/jbeckers/) was the trainer for SEC575 Mobile Device Security and Ethical Hacking.
The five days during the week had a good mix of theory and hands on.
And on saturday we hat the chance to compete in groupse in a capture the flag event.
All in all a perfect learning opportunity.
I also successfully certified as GIAC Mobile Device Security Analyst (GMOB).
After the training I extended my stay in London for a week.
