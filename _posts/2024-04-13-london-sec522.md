This week I had the chance to enjoy the [SEC522](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/application-security-securing-web-apps-api-microservices/)
course held by [Johannes Ullrich](https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich/).
The location ,the [Grand Connaught Rooms](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-events/london-april-2024/#location), were really interesting.
Many old rooms and some retrofitted to modern meeting rooms.

On Day 4 and 5 the *DFIR NetWars Tournament 2.0 - SANS London April 2024* event took place.
My colleague and I teamed up in our first ever forensic exercises.
We learned how to better filter network packets, analyze iphone backups, android images,
and much more. All in all it was a great experience. However, we had no chance
against the industry veterans present ;).

On Day6 (today) we closed up the Training with a Capstone exercise where I and
my colleague managed to win a coin in the solo challenges.

All in all a great experience with valuable lessons.
