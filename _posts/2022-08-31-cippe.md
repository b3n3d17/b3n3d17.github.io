# Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP(E) 

During my work at [Siemens] I got the opportunity to do a training at [iapp.org](https://iapp.org/store/trainings/#!/?designation=CIPP%2FE&amp;subcategories=Online&subcategories=Online).
After that I took the online certification exam through [pearsonvue.com](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Test-takers/OnVUE-online-proctoring.aspx).
