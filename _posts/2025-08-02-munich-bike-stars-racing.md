# Racing Thursdays at the Allianz Arena

When I first heard about the [Munich Bike Stars Donnerstagsrennen](https://www.munichbikestars.de/), I was both intrigued and intimidated. Racing at 18:00 on a Thursday evening, right next to the Allianz Arena? It sounded exciting and terrifying in equal measure.

The Munich Bike Stars Thursday races are something special in the German cycling scene. Since 2019, every summer a 1.5-kilometer circuit at Kurt-Landauer-Weg transforms into Munich's cycling hotspot. What started with 150 participants has grown to regularly seeing over 190 racers each Thursday from May through July.

> The Format

The races follow a criterium format with intermediate sprint points. Victory isn't just about crossing the finish line first - it's about accumulating points throughout the race. Every third lap features sprint points (5/3/2/1 points for places 1-4), with double points in the final sprint. This creates incredibly dynamic racing at speeds averaging 43-46.5 km/h.

The concept is brilliant: "Die etwas andere Feierabendrunde" (the somewhat different after-work ride). Four race categories accommodate everyone from youth racers to elite amateurs, licensed and unlicensed riders alike.

> My Experience

My first race was pure survival - learning criterium tactics while racing at 43 km/h around tight corners. What struck me most was the community spirit. Despite racing for individual glory and the coveted Munich Bike Stars title, riders looked out for each other and shared tactical advice.

As the 2025 season concludes, I'm already training for next year. The goal? Win one
race in the Hobby category and move up to the Jedermann category.

**Hauptsache Ballern!** (Main thing is to give it everything!)
