Recently I took part in the
[Kraken Hunter Workshop](https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-launches-partner-technical-accreditation-program/)
It was great fun with many learnings on how to secure workloads in the cloud, 
containers, K8s clusters and VMs.
And in the End we were [Kraken Hunters](https://www.credly.com/badges/757ff6e7-58a7-4ae9-810b-f0a006f5bd94/public_url)
