I'm excited to share an [IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp/) my collegue and I wrote on simplifying OAuth 2.0 for container orchestration. This draft shows how Service Account Token Volume Projection in k8s makes client authentciation easier and more secure for developers. If your interested please join in the discussion and [mail us](mailto:draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp@ietf.org?subject=Mail%20regarding%20draft-hofmann-wimse-workload-identity-bcp).
