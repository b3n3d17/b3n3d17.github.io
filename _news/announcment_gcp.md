Currently I am playing with Cloud Run on `GCP` (Awesome service ðŸš€.
However, using volumes is a pain. I can use `gcfuse` to _mount_ buckets to the
file-system - So far so good. However, it cannot be used for concurrent access.
I could use NFS volumes as the _only_ alternative, but the costs start at 200$/month.
Alternative: Provision small VM and start ... NFS ... so ... I need a ... VM for my
**SERVER LESS** application ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
